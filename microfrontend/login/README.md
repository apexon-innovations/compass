# Login APP

### How you can 

-    Here we used the create react app as a starter kit to make a Login app and it is a micro frontend app.
-   The main purpose of this app is to manage routing, state, authentication, Unit test cases, CSS and some API level logic to the login user. 
-    In this app, We include reusable-components as npm package (Please check RC repo readme for more details)
-    There is a separate CI/CD pipeline for Login APP upload on the server.
-    In the local machine, the Login app will work on 3000 PORT. (you can change it from package.json)
-    After login has been completed this app will redirect users to other micro app based on user role, will pass param in URL.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  /> You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm install build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br  />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br  />Your app is ready to be deployed!
